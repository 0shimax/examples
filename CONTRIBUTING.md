# Contributing Guide

The [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/README.md) project is dedicated to making machine learning on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable. We need your support in making
this repo the destination for top models and examples, which show the power of Kubeflow. We have created an initial list of
proposed manifests. Please feel free to self-assign these examples, by following a simple 3 step process:

* Identify an **example** in table below and put your github id against it
* Create a Github issue with the details of the **example** and self-assign
* Send a PR to this repo with the actual work for the example

We have assigned priorities to the items below. See priority guidance: 

* **P0**: Very important, try to self-assign if there is a P0 available
* **P1**: Important, try to self-assign if there is no P0 available
* **P2**: Nice to have
